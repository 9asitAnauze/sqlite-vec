# Razer Kraken Windows 11
  
If you want to use this Razer USB headset as your main playback device for all applications on the computer, it needs to be set in the Windows sound control panel as the default Windows playback device.

Hi Gale
Sorry. I ignored the pink box. I am using windows 8.1 with Audacity 2.0.6.
If a program was to do this problem, then which program should I configure.
Thanks Gale, Your the best help so far

In either of those cases that is happening because you installed a virtual sound device or some audio app that makes changes like that. If the problem only recently started happening, it may help to think of which applications you installed that may have caused the problem.
 
Hi Gale
Sorry about not responding for a while. It is the weekend here in Australia.
About the virtual audio device, I have a razer surround pro program. Do you think that could be the problem?
I know you cannot know every program that I have, but do you know any programs that could have any major conflicts with audacity and the headset?
Thankyou very much for your co-operation so far

Hi Gale
I have great news. its working again. It was a problem with Razer Synapse. All is well again. What happened was that synapse put audacity on mute and I had to unmute it.
YOU HOWEVER ARE THE GREATEST HELPER OF ALL TIME 
THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR GUIDANCE

I recently redeemed the Windows 10 edition of Minecraft, but I can't play it due to a really awful audio bug -- upon launching the game I hear a loud white noise / static buzz through my headset (Razer Kraken headset - the driver is managed by Razer's Surround software -- which is fully up to date). It's almost deafening.When i get in game its a wierd sound no matter what i do.(almost like chains or keys are like in a bag??? if that makes any sense)

Something very similar sounding had happened to me as well with my Kitty Kracken headset and Windows 10 Minecraft. It took me a while to figure it out, but the problem is that Minecraft doesn't work with the THX mode. You have to go into your audio settings and select the other option for this headset. You can't do it through Synapse, audio mixer, the button on the headset, etc. It has to be done in the computers settings. Hope this helps!
 
I was struggling with this issue and figured out how to fix it with the Razer Kraken Kitty Headset. Go to sound settings if you are on windows 11, scroll to the very bottom and click "more sound settings", right click on your kraken kitty audio source, go to properties, click spatial sound, and change it from off or whatever its on and switch it to Windows Sonic for Headphones. this will fix the audio distortion. If it doesn't work right after you do that, go to synapse and turn off THX audio under audio then mixer. Hope this helps!!!!!
 
I just encountered this problem myself, going into the control panel then going to the properties of my razer headset (Kraken Ultimate), going to surround sound, then setting it to "Windows Sonic for Headphones" fixed the issue!
